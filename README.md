* [Tunnelmole](https://github.com/robbie-cahill/tunnelmole-client/) - Open source and optionally self hostable. The client and server are both written in TypeScript.

* [tunnel.pyjam.as](https://tunnel.pyjam.as/) - No custom client; uses WireGuard directly instead. Written in Python. [source code](https://gitlab.com/pyjam.as/tunnel)
* [SSH-J.com](https://bitbucket.org/ValdikSS/dropbear-sshj/) -  Public SSH Jump & Port Forwarding server. No software, no registration, just an anonymous SSH server for forwarding. Users are encouraged to use it for SSH exposure only, to preserve end-to-end encryption. No public ports, only in-SSH connectivity. Run `ssh ssh-j.com` and it will display usage information.
